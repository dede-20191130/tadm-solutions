## Exercise 3-6
### Question

Suppose you seek to maintain the contents of a refrigerator so as to minimize
food spoilage. What data structure should you use, and how should you use
it?


### Solution

Queue is the most appropriate.

Assuming the time it takes for food to spoil is the same, food put into the refrigerator earlier is more likely to spoil than food put in later. So it's desirable for that put earlier to be comsumed.
