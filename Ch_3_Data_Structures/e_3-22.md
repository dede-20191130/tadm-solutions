## Exercise 3-22
### Question

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:
- insert(x) – Insert item x from the data stream to the data structure.
- median() – Return the median of all elements so far.  
All operations must take $O(log n)$ time on an n-element set.


### Solution

#### Conditions

We adopt binary search tree for this problem.  
We consider tree node structure like this (C++ notation):

```cpp
struct tree_node{
    int value;
    tree_node left;
    tree_node right;
    int num_of_left_children;
    int num_of_right_children;
}
```

`num_of_left_children` has the number of elements in left branch and so is `num_of_right_children`.

And we assume the tree's total size is always traced.

#### Routine

Median element is essentially $\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor$-th element of the ordered set.  
So the routine for finding median element is specialized version of the routine for finding k-th element.

```
Finding-Kth-Element(k)
    Let t=root node
    Loop:
        If(k==0) then
            Return t.value
        Else If(k < t.num_of_left_children) then
            --k
            t=t.left
        Else
            k-=t.left+1
            t=t.right
```

The search only pass h nodes (h:tree's height), so it takes $O(logn)$ time.
