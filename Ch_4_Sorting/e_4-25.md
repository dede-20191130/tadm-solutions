## Exercise 4-25

### Question

Consider a given pair of different elements in an input array to be sorted,
say $z_i$ and $z_j$ . What is the most number of times $z_i$ and $z_j$ might be compared
with each other during an execution of quicksort?


### Solution

1 time, no matter how we choose $z_i$ and $z_j$.

### Explanation

Comparison betweem $z_i$ and $z_j$ only occurs when either of the two is selected as pivot. And if one of them is selected, it's consumed as pivot and excluded the targets of swapping, so $z_i$ and $z_j$ are never compared.
