## Exercise 4-22

### Question

The median of a set of n values is the $\lceil n/2 \rceil$-th smallest value.  
(a) Suppose quicksort always pivoted on the median of the current sub-array.
How many comparisons would quicksort make then in the worst case?  
(b) Suppose quicksort always pivoted on the $\lceil n/3 \rceil$-th smallest value of the
current sub-array. How many comparisons would be made then in the
worst case?


### Solution

#### Subproblem (a)

In a partition part of Quicksort, the algorithm does n comparisons.  
The fact that the pivot is always median indicates that a partitioning produces two half-length arrays of their original array, which is an ideal case of Quicksort.  
So the number of repetition is $\lg{n}$ and the total number of comparisons is $n\lg{n}$.

#### Subproblem (b)

A partition produces a $\frac{1}{3}$-length array and a $\frac{2}{3}$-length array of their original array.  
So let h be a number of repetition (that is also the height of Quicksort recursion tree).  
Then, the following equation holds:

$$
\begin{align}
&(\frac{2}{3})^{h}*n=1\\
\iff &(\frac{3}{2})^{h}=n\\
\iff &h=\frac{1}{\lg{3}-\lg{2}}\lg{n}
\end{align}
$$

So, the number of comparisons is approximately $1.7n\lg{n}$.
