This is a **on-going** repository storing my solutions for exercises in the book "The Algorithm Design Manual 3rd Edition".  

The solutions here is the ones that i cannot find in the internet sea and decided to publish my owns to the github and my blog. So the correctness of them is not guaranteed.
