## Exercise 4-35

### Question

Let $A[1..n]$ be an array such that the first $n−√n$ elements are already sorted
(though we know nothing about the remaining elements). Give an algorithm
that sorts A in substantially better than $n\log{n}$ steps.


### Solution

First We sort $\sqrt{n}$ elements that's not yet sorted. This costs $O(\sqrt{n}\log{\sqrt{n}})$.  
Then we merge already sorted part and previously sorted $\sqrt{n}$ elements using Mergesort-like combination algorithm. This costs $O(n)$.

$\sqrt{n}$ dominates $\log{n}$, so n dominates $n\log{n}$.

The overall time complexity is:

$$
\begin{equation}
O(n)+O(\sqrt{n}\log{\sqrt{n}})=O(n)+O(\sqrt{n}\log{n})=O(n)
\end{equation}
$$
