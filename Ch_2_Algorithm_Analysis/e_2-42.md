## Exercise 2-42
### Question

When you first learned to multiply numbers, you were told that $x ×y$ means
adding x a total of y times, so $5 × 4 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20$. What is the time
complexity of multiplying two n-digit numbers in base b (people work in base 10,
of course, while computers work in base 2) using the repeated addition method,
as a function of n and b. Assume that single-digit by single-digit addition or
multiplication takes $O(1)$ time. (Hint: how big can y be as a function of n and
b?)


### Solution

\[1\] Name the two n-digit numbers as x, y.

x's replesentation in terms of n and b is following (the same applies y).

$$
\begin{equation}
    b^n \le x \lt b^{n+1}
\end{equation}
$$

So, the time complexity we want is multiple of the time complexity required for the calculation of "$x+x$" and $O(b^n)$.

\[2\] When we calculate "$x+x$", single-digit additions are required per its digits.  
x has n digit, so the time complexity for this calculation is $O(n)$.

\[3\] From \[1\] and \[2\], the time complexity we want is:


$$
\begin{equation}
    T=O(n)*O(b^n)=O(nb^n)
\end{equation}
$$
