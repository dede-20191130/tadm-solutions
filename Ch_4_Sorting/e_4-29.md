## Exercise 4-29

### Question

Suppose you are given k sorted arrays, each with n elements, and you want
to combine them into a single sorted array of kn elements. One approach is to
use the merge subroutine repeatedly, merging the first two arrays, then merging
the result with the third array, then with the fourth array, and so on until you
merge in the kth and final input array. What is the running time?


### Solution

The number of merging is $k-1$. Let $l_i$ be the number of total elements of two array involving the i-th merge.  
In the second half of merging (when $i \ge \frac{k-1}{2}$), $l_i$ is greater than or equal to the half of kn.

So, the following binding constraint on the running time holds:

$$
\begin{align}
&\frac{k-1}{2}*O(\frac{kn}{2})<\text{Running-time}<(k-1)*O(kn) \\
\implies &\text{Running-time}=\Theta(k^2n)
\end{align}
$$
