## Exercise 2-4
### Question

Suppose you have algorithms with the five running times listed below. (Assume these are the exact running times.) How much slower do each of these
algorithms get when you (a) double the input size, or (b) increase the input size
by one?  
(a) $n^2$ (b) $n^3$ (c) $100n^2$ (d) $nlogn$ (e) $2^n$

### Solution

#### Algorithm(a)
##### Size Change - double

$$
\begin{align}
(2n)^2 &=4n^2\\
       &=4*original
\end{align}
$$

Ans. Increased by *a factor of 4*

##### Size Change - by one

$$
\begin{equation}
(n+1)^2=original+(2n+1)
\end{equation}
$$

Ans. Increased by $2n+1$

#### Algorithm(b)
##### Size Change - double

$$
\begin{align}
(2n)^3 &=8n^3\\
       &=8*original
\end{align}
$$

Ans. Increased by *a factor of 8*

##### Size Change - by one

$$
\begin{equation}
(n+1)^3=original+(3n^2+3n+1)
\end{equation}
$$

Ans. Increased by $3n^2+3n+1$

#### Algorithm(c)
##### Size Change - double

Same as Algorithm(a)

##### Size Change - by one

How to think is the same as that for Algorithm(a).

Ans. Increased by $200n+100$

#### Algorithm(d)
##### Size Change - double

$$
\begin{align}
(2n)log2n &=2nlogn+2nlog2\\
       &=2*original+2nlog2
\end{align}
$$

Ans. The Running time is doubled and an additional $2nlog2$ is added.

##### Size Change - by one

$$
\begin{equation}
(n+1)log(n+1)=nlog(n+1)+log(n+1)
\end{equation}
$$

Let's think of the range of $log(n+1)$

$$
n<n+1 \le 2n \qquad (n\ge1)
$$

So,

$$
logn < log(n+1) \le logn+log2\qquad (n\ge1)
$$

Multiplying $n$ and Adding $log(n+1)$ to each expressions above introduces:

$$
\begin{align}
nlogn+log(n+1) &< nlog(n+1)+log(n+1) \\&\le nlogn+nlog2+log(n+1)\\
\implies original+log(n+1) &< (n+1)log(n+1)\\&\le original+nlog2+log(n+1)
\end{align}
$$

Ans. Increased by the amount between $log(n+1)$ and $nlog2+log(n+1)$.

#### Algorithm(b)
##### Size Change - double

$$
\begin{align}
2^(2n)  &= (2^n)^2\\
        &=original^2
\end{align}
$$

Ans. Increased to be the square of the original running time.

##### Size Change - by one

$$
\begin{align}
2^(n+1)  &= 2*(2^n)\\
        &=2*original
\end{align}
$$

Ans. Running times is doubled.
