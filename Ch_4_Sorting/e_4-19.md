## Exercise 4-19

### Question

You wish to store a set of n numbers in either a max-heap or a sorted array.
For each application below, state which data structure is better, or if it does not
matter. Explain your answers.
- (a) Find the maximum element quickly.
- (b) Delete an element quickly.
- (c) Form the structure quickly.
- (d) Find the minimum element quickly.

### Solution

#### Subproblem (a)

##### Conclusion

It does not matter.

##### Analisys

For max-heap, we get maximum by referencing the top of heap ($O(1)$), and for sorted array, which we consider is ascending sorted array, we get by referencing the last element ($O(1)$).

#### Subproblem (b)

##### Conclusion

Max-heap is better.

##### Analisys

Suppose we have a reference to an element to be deleted in advance.

For max-heap, it takes $O(\log{n})$ rearrangement time after the deletion, while for sorted array it takes $O(n)$ rearrangement time.

#### Subproblem (c)

##### Conclusion

Max-heap is better.

##### Analisys

Construction time comparison:  
- Max-heap: $O(n)$
- Sorted array: $O(\log{n})$

#### Subproblem (d)

##### Conclusion

Sorted array is better.

##### Analisys

It takes $O(n)$ time for max-heap to find minimum because we must examine all leaf nodes. On the other hand, we get minimum element in sored array in $O(1)$ time by referencing the first element.
