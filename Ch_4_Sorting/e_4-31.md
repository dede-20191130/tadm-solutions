## Exercise 4-31

### Question

Stable sorting algorithms leave equal-key items in the same relative order
as in the original permutation. Explain what must be done to ensure that
mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm.


### Solution

The requirement of the stability is that when merging two arrays, of two elements with the same value, the element from the left (lower indices) array takes precedence over the ones from the right (higher indices).
