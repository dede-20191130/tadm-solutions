## Exercise 3-8
### Question

Tic-tac-toe is a game played on an n × n board (typically $n = 3$) where two
players take consecutive turns placing “O” and “X” marks onto the board cells.
The game is won if n consecutive “O” or ‘X” marks are placed in a row, column,
or diagonal. Create a data structure with $O(n)$ space that accepts a sequence
of moves, and reports in constant time whether the last move won the game.


### Solution

#### Precondition

The signature of the adopted data structure is:

`array<pair<char, int>, 2n+2>` (c++ notation.)

The concept:  
Elements in the array contain a status for the corresponding position (row, column, diagonal lines).  
The status is represented as `pair<char, int>`, which first data is the type of current status and the second is number of the type placed in the position.

The list of types:  
E (Empty), O, X, B (Both).

The description of 'position':  
- k-th row's status is denoted by (k-1)-th element in the array.  
- l-th row's status is denoted by (n+(l-1))-th element.  
- Rising diagonal line's status is denoted by (2n)-th element.  
- Falling diagonal line's status is denoted by (2n+1)-th element.  

Example of positions (n=3):  
```
[
    status-row1, status-row2, status-row3, 
    status-column1, status-column2, status-column3, 
    status-rising-diagonal, status-falling-diagonal
]
```

#### Procedures

Game procedure:  
```sql
Let placing_count=0
Let turn_flg=false
Loop while placing_count<9
    Select player to place by (turn_flg is false? 'O' : 'X')
    The player places their symbol to the position (R_x, C_y).
    Call Status-changing-procedure(symbol, R_x-1)
    Call Status-changing-procedure(symbol, n+C_y-1)
    If R_x+C_y==n+1 then
        Call Status-changing-procedure(symbol, 2n)
    If R_x==C_y then
        Call Status-changing-procedure(symbol, 2n+1)
    placing_count++
Announce the game ended in a draw.
```

Status-changing procedure:  
```sql
Procedure(symbol, index for position)
    Let target_status=array[position]
    If target_status.first_data=='E' then ## The status is still empty.
        target_status.first_data=symbol
        target_status.second_data=1
        exit the procedure
    If target_status.first_data=='B' then ## the status already invalidated
        exit the procedure
    If target_status.first_data!=symbol then
        target_status.first_data='B' ## invalidate the status
        exit the procedure

    target_status.second_data++

    If target_status.second_data==n then ## achieve the winning condition
        Announce the winner is the player with the symbol
        End whole game

```
