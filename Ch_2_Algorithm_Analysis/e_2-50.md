## Exercise 2-50
### Question

Consider the following algorithm to find the minimum element in an array
of numbers $A[0,...,n]$. One extra variable tmp is allocated to hold the current
minimum value. Start from $A[0]$; tmp is compared against $A[1], A[2], . . . , A[N]$
in order. When $A[i] < tmp$, $tmp = A[i]$. What is the expected number of times
that the assignment operation $tmp = A[i]$ is performed?


### Solution

The probability that the kth element is minimum among the range $[A(0),A(k)]$ is $\frac{1}{k+1}$.

So, the expected number of times is the summation of probability above from $k=0$ to $k=n$.

The formula is:

$$
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{1}{k+1}=O(\log{n})
\end{equation}
$$
